## **1. Problem Statement**

### **Current Challenges**
Modern students face significant challenges in managing their learning activities:

1. **Tool Fragmentation:** Students use 5-7 different applications daily (Google Classroom, MS Teams, note-taking apps, calendar, to-do lists)
2. **Data Silos:** Information scattered across multiple platforms with no cross-platform synchronization
3. **Productivity Loss:** 30-45 minutes daily spent switching between applications and searching for information
4. **Progress Tracking Difficulty:** No unified view of learning progress across different subjects and platforms
5. **Integration Gaps:** Limited connectivity between institutional platforms (KMITL, MS Teams) and personal learning tools

### **Market Research Findings**
- **Target Audience:** University students, online learners, self-directed learners
- **Pain Points:** Time management, information organization, progress tracking
- **Current Solutions:** Fragmented tools (Notion, Google Keep, Todoist) without integration
- **Market Gap:** No comprehensive solution that bridges institutional and personal learning tools
